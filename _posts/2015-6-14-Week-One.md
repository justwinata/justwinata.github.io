To be honest, I'm pretty nervous to be taking Glenn Downing's Software Engineering course at UT Austin during the summer. I've heard many great things about it like how well it simulates real-world programming, teaches you how to work in a team, relevant projects with great resume value, and more. However, I did also hear a lot about how it is not particularly easy, can take up a lot of time, and how the code-only exams were not particularly fun. I was hoping that taking CS361 alongside this course would be ok since Young's class is well-known to be pretty easy, but during the summer session, there is quite an amount of work involved since it is compacted to just a few weeks. I'm also taking part in some instense biblical and spiritual discipline training from church this summer, involving a lot of reading and writing.

As for my first impressions of the class, it's been pretty interesting. I've never had such an interactive course in the CS department before. I really enjoy Downing's teaching style, keeping individual students involved and alert.

As for my tip-of-the-week, I'd say to get to know your classmates early. It's comforting to know that you're not alone in there, especially when your name gets called out to answer questions, and to just check your progress on projects and material.

I'm looking forward to all of the experience I will gain from getting through this class, but I'm just hoping I can survive. Wish me luck!
